## Title
Recipe blog
## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I created it on 21.09.23 to practise using React Routing. On the "Recipes" page, there's a list of recipes which can be sorted in different ways. This was achieved with searchParams. There is also a search field which filters the recipts according to the user's search term and uses createSearchParams. You can then click into each recipe and the relevant info is displayed. There is a "back" button which uses useNavigate() to move through the history stack.
